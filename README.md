Millennial Data Dashboard
In 2013, students of the Statistics class at FSEV UK were asked to invite their friends to participate in this survey.
The dataset accrued over 1000 participants and captured the fears, hobbies, and habits of a generation of young people.
The original questionnaire was in Slovak language and was later translated into English.
All participants were of Slovakian nationality, aged between 15-30.

UX
This project was designed for anyone with an interest in the psychology of young people.
To achieve this, most data is displayed graphically, to better illustrate the findings of the survey.

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
As a music producer, I want to learn more about young people's music interest, to better cater to their tastes.
As a movie studio, I want to learn more about young people's viewing habits, so I can generate more content that will appeal to them.
